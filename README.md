# CKA-Study-Guide
This is my (Ned Bellavance) study guide for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam. In the guide I plan to include relevant study materials, the exam objectives, and code examples.

## How to use this guide

I'm just starting to write the guide, so honestly I'm not sure how it will be used. My best guess is to look at my notes for each objective and check out the code examples.

## Pre-requisites
Personally I plan to use a combination of Docker Desktop, minikube, and Azure Kubernetes Service to work on the code exercises. I may also try *Kubernetes the Hard Way* except on Microsoft Azure to save money. I've got `kubectl` installed, along with helm. And I am going to use Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 for the exercises. We'll see how it goes.

## Branching
My plan is to create a branch for each objective and merge the branches into `main` when I feel each is completed. Please don't commit to main.
